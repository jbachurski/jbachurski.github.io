    <p>
        Subtyping is a classical programming language feature, usually associated with <i>nominal</i> subtyping in
        object-oriented programming. <b>Structural subtyping</b> — where the subtyping relation is derived from the
        shared structure of types — is an alternative. Various structural typing approaches have seen interest, but
        these are often incomplete without subtyping, which ends up omitted because of its complexity. <br>

        I argue that with the introduction of <b>algebraic subtyping</b> — a new framework for ML-style type
        inference — the time has come to revisit structural subtyping. In my thesis I propose a novel language
        design, <b>Fabric</b>, and demonstrate the relevance of structural subtyping to modern design problems. As
        part of the project, I propose a new approach to typing array programs, show how to capture record extension
        within algebraic subtyping, and compile Fabric into WebAssembly with a focus on efficient core data
        structures. I aim to show structural subtyping could narrow the expressive gap between static and dynamic
        languages, and its ideas can improve how we use both.
