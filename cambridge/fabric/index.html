    <p>
        Subtyping is a classical programming language feature, usually associated with <i>nominal</i> subtyping in
        object-oriented programming. <b>Structural subtyping</b> — where the subtyping relation is derived from the
        shared structure of types — is an alternative. Structural typing is present in many forms in modern languages,
        but it is often incomplete without subtyping. Regardless, subtyping often ends up omitted because of its
        inherent complexity. <br />

        I argue that with the introduction of <b>algebraic subtyping</b> — a new framework for ML-style type
        inference — the time has come to revisit structural subtyping. In my thesis I propose a novel language
        design, <b>Fabric</b>, and demonstrate the relevance of structural subtyping to modern design problems. I
        propose a new approach to typing array programs, show how to capture record extension within algebraic
        subtyping without row polymorphism, and compile Fabric into WebAssembly with a focus on efficient core data
        structures. I aim to show structural subtyping could narrow the expressive gap between static and dynamic
        languages, and its ideas can improve how we use both.

            <h3>Type system</h3>

            <p>
                Fabric's type system follows the framework of <b>algebraic subtyping</b>, as set out by Stephen Dolan in
                his thesis (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3009837.3009882">MLsub</a>) and later refined by
                Lionel Parreaux (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3409006">Simple-sub</a>, <a
                    href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3563304">MLstruct</a>). When following this tradition, we
                define a lattice algebra over types, with meets and joins over any pair of types. For instance, in
                MLsub:

                $$ \texttt{select}\,p\,v\,d = \texttt{if}\, p\,v \,\texttt{then}\, v \,\texttt{else}\, d $$
                $$ \forall \alpha, \beta \ldotp (\alpha \to \texttt{bool}) \to \alpha \to \beta \to (\alpha \sqcup
                \beta) $$

                In Fabric I implement the type system following MLstruct, which removes the <i>polarity restriction</i>
                and supports a limited form of negation types. I explore the capabilities and limitations of this
                Boolean algebraic approach to algebraic subtyping. Subtyping, as in similar work, is implicit in Fabric.
            </p>

            <h4>Records</h4>

            <p>
                A key feature present in both statically and dynamically typed languages are aggregate <i>record
                    types</i>. Dynamic languages (Python, JavaScript, Lua) often call these <i>objects</i>, and check
                attribute accesses at runtime. I believe we can get much of the benefits of objects without sacrificing
                safety by typing them structurally. In the past, successful approaches to this have relied on the
                application of row polymorphism
                – an extension to Hindley-Milner type systems (e.g. <a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/objects">OCaml's
                    object types</a>, or <a
                    href="https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/language/Records.md">PureScript's
                    records</a>).
                <!--
                In fact, OCaml's <i>object types</i> can be seen as structural records (and they
                complement <i>polymorphic variants</i>, i.e. structural variant types). The two rely on a limited form
                of row polymorphism, and subtyping is explicit.
                -->
                <br />

            <pre><code class="language-ocaml">
(* type annotations are added for clarity *)
let p: {x: int, y: int} = {x: 3, y: 4}
let cp: {x: int, y: int, c: [ Green ]} = {c: Green | p}
let hypot v = v.x*v.x + v.y*v.y
let h = hypot cp (* 25 *)
            </code></pre>

            I propose to use algebraic subtyping as a basis for typing records instead, without the inclusion of row
            polymorphism. To make this possible, I propose a solution to the update problem of subtyping (see <a
                href="https://theory.stanford.edu/people/jcm/papers/cardelli-mitch-op-91.pdf">Cardelli and
                Mitchell</a>).
            </p>

            <h4>Arrays</h4>

            It is known that structural types (be it via row polymorphism or otherwise) can be useful for typing
            operations on dataframes. However, this approach remains unexplored for arrays, with the array programming
            community failing to discover a satisfactory approach to typing array programs in modern workloads (e.g. for
            machine learning models and scientific computing).

            Most widely adopted languages only give a cursory treatment of array types, only providing (some of) the
            following:
            <ul>
                <li>A single-dimensional array (vector) type</li>
                <li>A multi-dimensional array of arbitrary dimension</li>
                <li>A family of nominal <i>k</i>-dimensional array types</li>
            </ul>
            This lack of structure fails to reflect the rich array transformations we need to perform.
            I argue to resolve this via the use of structural types, with the following core ideas:
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple dimensions are modelled as (Cartesian) <b>products</b>.</li>
                <li>Concatenations are modelled as (ordered) <b>sums</b>.</li>
            </ul>
            For example, consider a matrix of floats. We may write its type as \([\mathrm{row}, \mathrm{col}]
            \Rightarrow \texttt{float}\), where \( \mathrm{row} \) and \( \mathrm{col} \) are index types (we could set
            them to \( \texttt{int} \), or to be variables). Let us add <i>padding</i> rows to this matrix, one at the
            left and right. This changes its structure significantly enough to mandate reflecting this in its type:
            $$ [(\mathrm{Left}: \langle \rangle \mid \mathrm{Center}: \mathrm{row} \mid \mathrm{Right}: \langle
            \rangle), \mathrm{col}] \Rightarrow \texttt{float} $$

            <h3>Code generation</h3>

            <p>
                I implemented a Fabric compiler into <a href="https://webassembly.org">WebAssembly</a>, a modern and
                portable compilation target.<br />

                WebAssembly is a convenient target. WebAssembly runtimes are shipped in most web browsers, but local
                runtimes and ahead-of-time compilers also exist. It aims to provide a solid abstraction over hardware. I
                thus expect its performance to be a good baseline above other possible targets. <br />

                I rely on the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen">Binaryen</a>
                toolchain for generating WebAssembly code. Fabric is a managed memory language, and so I made rich use
                of
                the recently adopted <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc">WasmGC</a> extensions.

                The main motive that leads me to look at code generation is that structural subtyping requires careful
                compilation schemes for its core data structures (records, variants). I thus aim to answer the following
                questions:
            <ul>
                <li>Can we quantify the performance impacts of language features using structural subtyping?</li>
                <li>How does the performance of different record representations compare?</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Properties</h3>

            Many type systems limit the user's capabilities to define their own rules in the type system. Powerful type
            system features like <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/gadts-tutorial.html">GADTs</a> permit encoding
            this, but the <i>proof burden</i> is often left to the user. <br />

            I would like to explore a structural system of <i>properties</i>, describing extra information about a value
            and supplementing its type. Properties can be required by a function, and they can be derived from other
            known properties via user-defined inference rules.

            <pre><code class="language-ocaml">
(* say, BLAS routine for symmetric matrix multiply *)
val symm : matrix @ {symm} -> matrix -> matrix -> matrix

(* encode rules on higher-level properties of matrices *)
rule {upper_triangular, lower_triangular} |- {diagonal}.
rule {orthogonal} |- {invertible}.
